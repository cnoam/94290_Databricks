The apartment was spotless, well-equipped, and exactly as described. The location was perfect — close to everything yet peaceful and relaxing. The hosts were incredibly friendly, responsive, and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br/>Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. We’d definitely love to come back again!\",\"Fantastic stay at Broadbeach, amazing location and the condo was fully equipped with very comfortable beds. The place was squeaky clean and the Tim Tams on arrival was a cute thought. They’d really thought of everything that you’d need during the stay and we couldn’t have wanted anything more. Thanks again, we will definitely stay again!\",\"Amazing location walking distance to prestine beach, restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops with Woolworths literally next door. The accommodation itself was modernly furnished with great amenities and super clean. The service provided by Broadbeach Luxury Stays from inquiry to check-in was second to none. highly recommended.\",\"A great compact, modern apartment with excellent facilities.  Main bedroom great size with views and sliding doors which allow good breeze to flow through.  2nd bedroom has no window but is a good size.  Bathroom is jack and jill style - comfy bath to relax in and plenty of space for toiletries.  Well equipped kitchenette and laundry.  Walkable to Pacific Fair and restaurants in Broadie.  An enjoyable stay.  Would stay again.\",\"Amazing stay. <br/>All boxes ticked. Cleanliness, location, communication and comfort. Enjoyed our stay.\",\"From the check in through to the departure everything was just beautiful. The apartment has everything you need and it’s lovely sitting outside on the balcony enjoying the weather. The hosts were very helpful and provided a personal check in. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.\",\"it is rare to enter a property and immediately feel a sense of warmth and  comfort. It is also not often to find a property that ends up being better than the pics. Karin was extremely welcoming and informative. <br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all.our needs were provided for. <br/>The level of cleanliness is 5 star. We will certainly be returning.\",\"Great unit in the heart of Broadbeach. Kitchen facilities are handy. Located on level 6, room 608. Parking was in basement level 3. Cafe downstairs was very nice and convenient. <br/>It was fine for us but the main bedroom has a wall of frosted glass between the bathroom. No curtain so light at night lights up main bedroom. Would recommend a blind or curtain.\",\"Fantastic! Quite at night but still just a walk to everything\",\"Lovely decorated apartment that is very well stocked with all the essentials you need.<br/>Fantastic local\",\"The apartment was one of the best I have stayed in so clean beds were so comfortable they have thought of everything you would need it's a fantastic location for beach restaurants shopping had the best time thanks fir having us Cathy Alex  from New zealand\",\"We absolutely loved our four night stay. The check-in process with Karin was great and the unit itself was wonderful and in a terrific location. Could not recommend more highly.\",\"We were two colleagues, going to a conference at the conference centre. The location was great for this, being very walkable, with several cafes between the two. The beach was also a short walk away so this was a perfect location for us. The apartment has the bathroom in between the two bedrooms, so some bathroom door closure protocols had to be established between the two of us and it was fine. There is a big glass window between the bathroom and big bedroom, but the frosting on the glass reduces the view into the bathroom. There is one big bedroom with great views and one small bedroom without windows which can be dark. Cleanliness and functionality of everything was great. Would happily stay again.\",\"Highly recommend this apartment! Super comfortable space with lots of natural light! Great location 3 minute walk to the beach and host was responsive and met us for checkin. Would stay here again, thank you!\",\"Great place to stay highly recommend this property\",\"Great location, amazing hosts. Would stay again\",\"This is a lovely apartment to stay.

A major attraction in the area is the fully restored amazing and historic Port Welshpool Long Jetty...a must visit family friendly jetty with beautiful safe beach surrounds. You can be as busy as you wish or relaxed as you may need:) there are so many things to do and see for adults and kids alike including great fishing, lovely safe beaches as well as bike tracks or if you like to walk or hike there are so many beautiful unspoilt areas for all to enjoy all within easy reach of Melbourne. Come stay and enjoy at a price we have set so a break is affordable to all -all we ask is that you treat the house as your own and respect the rate we charge and in return please clean on departure. Many thanks!The house has beautiful wooden cathedral ceilings with delightful character. Recently fully renovated with a new kitchen, bathroom and furnishings. A reverse cycle air conditioner for summer and winter comfort and great heating for those cosy winter nights and there is also a wood heater (so sorry wood not provided now as it would weirdly \"disappear\" when we did) There is a large lounge / open living plan with new kitchen with absolutely everything you will need along with microwave, ceramic cooktop,  Aldi Coffee maker and lots of bench space and walk in pantry. There is a 50” Ultra HD TV along with the Foxtel Entertainment Package which includes 9 Sports Channels for the boys (including Fox Sports) plus STAN for your enjoyment ...and FREE WIFITwo good size bedrooms one with a comfy queen bed (including 37\" TV in the main bedroom) and the other with a double bed and a single so comfortably sleeps 5.Along 2 full sides of the house is a delightful covered verandah that gets lots of sun and shade (not to mention the peaceful outlook lovely to view the native birds and a lovely area to have breakie or have a drink or BBQ in the eve- there is a gas BBQ available. We have several board games to play which we often do!! If you have a boat there is lots of room on the large easily accessible corner block with the store (great fish and chips), the beach and jetty just a few minutes walk away. – So bring the kids fishing rods!NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen, towels and toiletries etc (everything else is there incl shampoo body wash, hand soaps, toilet rolls etc) and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)PETS: Also please note (and sorry) we do not allow pets after three VERY bad experiences. We used to welcome the family pet as we have animals ourselves, but many dollars later with repairs we have had to make due to irresponsible people we have now changed our policy - apologies to all the responsible pet owners out there.ATTRACTIONS IN THE AREA (and Things to do just to name a few)The brand new and famous (now totally restored) Port Welshpool Long JettyA lovely kid’s safe beachWhale Watching cruises leave from Port Welshpool (seasonal)Wilsons PromAgnes FallsToora Wind FarmTarra Bulga National Park – Wow!Port Albert (Historic Fishing Village)Lovely Cafes in Toora, Foster and YarramGreat Fishing and Swimming Wildlife galoreLovely Walkways, bike tracks and Tramping optionsHistoric Museums WELCOME TO PORT WELSHPOOL -VICTORIAS SECRET A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVENThe Port and surrounds Port Welshpool is a lovely drive of about 90 minutes from Cranbourne once you hit the Sth Gippsland Highway and is in an undiscovered \"peaceful paradise\" just a short drive from beautiful and unspoilt Wilsons Prom. We own our lovely \"home away from home\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \"The Port\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.Guest accessEntire houseOther things to noteNOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)</td><td>Stays</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>[\"It’s a nice peaceful place to get away from busy city life.

Can't stress enough...Extremely good value reduced to simply treat their house like you would your own (and we stayed in high holiday season when caravan parks were costly). We had a lovely intimate family Christmas escape from the city to the fresh air and quiet peaceful surrounds. Check out the general store for some great fish and chips too! Kerry, Jo and Ezra are fabulous hosts responding quickly (even over Christmas) to any questions and providing a wealth of information on the area which is also listed in a binder on arrival.

We own our lovely \\\"home away from home\\\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \\\"The Port\\\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\"},{\"title\":\"Guest access\",\"value\":\"Entire house\"},{\"title\":\"Other things to note\",\"value\":\"NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \\\"relaxees\\\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\"}]</td><td>\n",

In the same time, it is a quiet place with an amazing view of the forest behind the city walls towards the White Tower.The place is located in one of the iconic historical buildings in Brasov. It was built in the 18th Century on the old City walls(you can still see the old city wall from the window) and the building was used as a the main eye hospital in Transilvania.The spaceThe apartment was designed in a way that it keeps some of its' older vibe, but in the same time provide its' guests with the highest level of comfort possible.Since the ceilings are so high, we took advantage of this for the first bedroom where we designed a whole structure so that we can have the bed on an upper level, thus taking advantage of the space below where we set up a small desk and some storage spaces. We also welcome you to the round table, which is a perfect place to have some fun with your family or friends. This space also works as a living room since it's exactly above the entrance of the apartment in a common accessed area For the other bedroom, given the size of the room, we went for large pieces of furniture, trying also to keep a more vintage aspect to it and not overcrowd the room.  You will immediately notice the old wood stove in the corner which towers and looks over the whole room from the corner.The kitchen and the bathroom are both fully equipped for any of your needs, and we also wanted to make sure that both of them have something special to offer to our guests from a design perspective. You will notice the old wood stove in the bathroom as it is has been transformed to encompass the sink area.Guest accessFor parking you have one available 100 meters away. Given the central location I highly recommend you ditch the car and explore the city by foot. There is also a bus station close by to explore other parts of the city, and if you enjoy skiing during winter, or just want to have a stroll, the bus station towards Poiana Brasov is only 500 meters away.</td><td>Stays</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>[\"Lovely apartment, clean and suited a family of four. Our kids are 9 and 11 and enjoyed the mezzanine bed. Very tastefully decorated and close to main square in Brasov.\",\"We arrive from the airport and it was about 15 minutes walk. Sobway/metro was just around the corner. had a few restaurants within walking distance. overall good\",\"The Apartment was advertised as a 2 bedrooms apartment. In reality  our 2 grownup kids had to crawl to the matress up in the gallery/attic. We  filled our kids age in the filling forms. It was clear that our children are grownups. Yet the apartment was promoted as a 2 bedrooms apartment suitable for 4 persons. The second room was not a bedroom, but rather a dinning room with a mattress  at the attic. Not suitable for adult grownup children. Our children didn't sleep well in a suitable bed and it ruined all our stay. We think it would be appropriate to be truthfull with the advertisement and discription of the apartment. Not suitable for a familly with big children.\",\"Pros: absolutely stunning apartment, fantastic decorations, very clean, comfortable beds, large TV, close to main square (2 min walk), easy access, friendly staff, responsive owner, large bathroom<br/>Cons: thin walls and next door Airbnb has a piano which guests played at 1am, second bedroom on mezzanine above main front door not that private and could get noise from squeaky floors\",\"I stayed here for three days and absolutely loved it. The place is wonderful—cozy, intimate, beautifully designed, and very practical. It has a special charm, with heritage pieces that give it a unique and refined atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can’t wait to return to.<br/>During my stay, I had three days of work and found the space very conducive to productivity. Unfortunately, on the first day, there was a lot of noise from a team of workers nearby, which disrupted my focus. However, the hosts were incredibly attentive and welcoming. As soon as I mentioned the issue, they promptly took care of it, and from the second day onwards, it was perfectly quiet.<br/>I’m very grateful for their hospitality and care and would definitely come back again for both work and leisure. A truly special place!\",\"So beautiful my wife asked how do we buy this place as soon as we walked in. Hard with parking and a family though as summer in Brasov is busy and not always lots of parking. But the place itself is amazing.  My son loved sleeping in the loft bed which was an awesome experience\",\"We had an amazing stay in this beautiful apartment. The bedroom is stunning. Right in the centre of town. Highly recommend.\",\"An absolutely beautiful flat, nicer than the photos in the listing. Very comfortable, set back from the street and very quiet with a lovely view of trees.\",\"Great apartment in a great location with a gorgeous kitchen and main bedroom.\",\"Really beautiful place! We had a great time. It is in an ideal location\",\"Andreis Flat is just beautiful. We really felt like home and would for sure come again!\",\"Clean spacious place. Close to everything!\",\"Amazing stay, central location and nice restaurants.\",\"Great place…perfect location\",\"I recommend it.\",\"Everything went great! :)\",\"The apartment is as shown in the pictures! Very spacious, tidy and tastefully decorated. Outstanding location. Andrei very friendly and antento. Highly recommended! :)\",\"What a great accommodation! It is right next to the old square and the master bedroom has a gorgeous view of the White Tower and a lush green backyard full of cherry trees. The master is like a bedroom for royalty. Large and spacious to the extreme. The second bedroom is more of a platform bed, rather than a room itself. The kitchen has the basic necessities for morning coffee and scrambled eggs\uD83D\uDE0A. There are many great restaurants within a short walking distance. Andrei was super responsive and flexible with our checkin time. I highly recommend this Airbnb\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB\",\"Fantastic two night stay at Cuba apartment. Beautifully decorated. Spotlessly clean. Warm and cozy despite the snow outside . Great views from the windows of the Brasov sign and white tower. Very responsive hosts . <br/>The perfect location to stay  in beautiful Brasov square.  I highly recommend and will definitely return to Brasov and stay here again .\",\"This is a wonderful spacious apartment, beautifully furnished, quite location, super clean and airy, in the heart of Brasov. Andrei is a gem! He was  incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive to our needs.<br/>The weather wasn't the greatest but Andrei's place made this trip one to remember.<br/>Thank you ever so much, Andrei!<br/>Looking forward to visiting again some time soon!\",\"We are Romanians living abroad, returning to our country for vacations as often as we can. Brasov and the surrounding areas are some of our favourite places to be. <br/>We tried a good few places in Brasov, but this one is hands down the best of them all! <br/>I love how they carefully saved the architecture of the building, the old fireplaces with museum worthy features and the wooden floors. <br/>You can see that’s someone is taking great care of this place. <br/>Highly recommended!!!\",\"I travelled for 3 weeks across Netherlands, Austria and Romania and this was by far the best place we stayed at. Well designed, lots of space, high ceilings, big bathroom space, everything was great. Even the view from the window while it snowed was magical. While Andrei helped us on chat, we met one of the hosts in person - Toni and had some great conversations. Toni set us up with a great guide/host who took us around all the castles. Overall an amazing experience and a great space and right next to the town square.\",\"The apartment is right in the heart of the old town center. Everything you would want to visit or see is in walking distance. <br/>From the bedroom you have a great view of the White Tower. From the living room you can see the top of the Tampa mountain with the BRASOV sign, over the rooftops.  <br/>The kitchen is top modern and the bathroom is huge. The bedroom is enormous. Everything looks exactly as in the pictures.\",\"We rented this space for the 4 of us. We got there and we were so impressed by the interior design, everything is newly renovated, a mix of modern but with rustic colours, well thought. Also the romanian traditional heaters (soba) were kept in, so impressed and appreciated. <br/>The beds are comfortable. The big bedroom is really huge, we loved it! <br/>The location is best you can get, right in the heart of the city. <br/>Highly recommend this!

Michalis greeted us and shared recommendations for the best restaurants, beaches, etc on Paros and Antiparos which was super helpful! The house is only 10 minute walk from the village which gave us privacy and amazing views. The house is well equipped and clean. The back terrace was our favorite place to hang out in the evenings while watching the sunset.\",\"Absolutely loved our stay! Spacious and very clean, one room is completely separate which was great for the couples to have their own areas and the amenities were perfect! Great for families or couples!\",\"We had a great time at Michalis's place, very welcoming host and available anytime. The place was in pristine condition with all the necessary amenities. A breathtaking sea view in the middle of nature . We highly recommend your place to stay. No negative points.\",\"Wounderful stay. Amazing house with a lot of space and everything you need to unwind and just relax! Very friendly and welcoming host. Highly recommended!\",\"Nice people <br/>Helpful <br/>Slightly out of the way however nice privacy \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\",\"Perfect accommodation, spacious and comfortable, with a wonderful terrace for after-dinner drinks. Everything was great\",\"We felt at home. Michalis and his wife were always available to help us, very responsive but most of all very very sweet! The house was beautiful and clean and has a breathtaking view. They left water, wine, local olive oil and anything we could need for the beach as well. So many nice touches. We were a group of friends and I hope to take my family here one day. Thank you both!\",\"Very good hosting by Michalis, full of good advice. Perfect house. Very nice place.\",\"Beautiful home, breathtaking views, 5-10 min walk to Aliki, its beautiful beaches and delicious waterfront restaurants. A place we highly recommend, much nicer than the more touristy towns of Parikia or Naoussa. Very comfortable bedding, very well-equipped kitchen, impeccable cleanliness, beach chairs and umbrella very much appreciated. And Michalis is very available, kind, enthusiastic, generous with his time and information. Is there any better compliment?<br/>Thanks for everything.\",\"Everything was perfect, the house is very clean and beautiful, with a nice area in front of the house that has a stunning view on the sea. Michelis and his wife are very nice hosts, trying to make everything they can to make you enjoy your stay. Definitely a place I recomand !\",\"The villa fits comfortably the needs of 6 adults.The place is quiet and the seaview as well as sunset view are superb.The cleanliness of the villa and the kindness of the host are both strong arguments to recommend the villa.\",\"Great stay, the house is superb and we were able to enjoy the outdoors and the garden.<br/>Our host was very nice and available. I would recommend this place, close to the center and easy to access. Thank you\",\"This is exactly what all Airbnb experiences should be like. The perfect stay in a dream villa. The warm host Michalis took care of every need and surprised us along the way. The villa is very spacious with amazing views. It is impeccably clean, and the terrace is a gorgeous place to spend your evening with a Greek wine overlooking the Aegean. I have stayed in villas around the world and I don't have a single piece of feedback - I can only recommend it to whoever reads this message.\",\"We visited Villa Theros in August. The house is even better than the photos. It is brand new. It is decorated with taste and character. It is fully equipped and has a great BBQ spot. The verandas are amazing with a great view. The garden is very well maintained. Our daughter loved collecting figs from the trees. We really appreciated that the surrounding area was peaceful. The owners were great and welcoming. Communication before arrival was really good and precise. So sad we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely go back again!\",\"An Airbnb can not get better in our opinion. If we were ever to own one we would model it after what Michalis and his wife have created. It was perfection for us. Loved the location and the peace and quiet. Yet it is only a short walk to shops and restaurants. What a delightful find... it was our favorite place in Greece.\",\"Michalis’ villa exceeded our expectations in every way. He’s house was so well appointed thought out and tastefully designed with everything we needed in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms . There is an amazing outdoor kitchen and gorgeous back deck with the most amazing sunsets and views . There was also a  fruit and vegetable garden we could pick from to add to our breakfasts and dinners. Every moment in the day was tranquil and picturesque with unobstructed views of the surrounding hills and oceans.<br/>Michalis was a kind and generous host and supplied us everything we could need . He had  lists, maps and tours all ready for us. If you are thinking about coming to Paros please consider staying at Michalis Villa , PARADISE !!!\",\"We stayed at Villa Theros as a group of six for nine days in September. <br/>I cannot reccommend it enough. The accommodation is spacious, tasteful, equipped with everything you could possibly need and it is brand new. <br/>It is in a peaceful yet convenient location about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the local village and beaches. The views over the surrounding are and sea are amazing. Michalis and Vaso were so friendly, fantastic hosts and seriously went above and beyond to ensure our experience was the best possible. Their advice on where to explore on the island was also invaluable. <br/>Overall, a fantastic experience and would not hesitate to return.\",\"5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH for this home.   You will love it, no question.  It is wonderfully renovated, exquisitely decorated, generously hosted, thoroughly supplied, and strategically located.  It is quiet and relaxing, perfect inside/out, and offers glorious views of country, sea, and town.    You will adore this home, we can guarantee it.  Our credentials to review are bolstered by at least 100 previous rental experiences in countries around the world.  This home brought together the best of all of those experiences, and none of the bad.  Many places we have stayed before have had lovely views, but poor renovation or equipping.  That was not the case here, it is the full package and leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.   The quality of the renovation is impeccable, carefully considered, and obviously the fruit of professional architects and interior designers.  That is only the beginning.  The furnishing and decoration are attractive, subtle, and practical.   The kitchen is a gift to travelers like us that have spent too much time in other rentals looking for sharp knives, cutting boards, oil/salts, or other simple and obvious things.  The hosts have handled the basic, and gone above and beyond to a degree that made us feel perfectly at home, and their concern and thoroughness was truly amazing.    As for the hosts, Michalis and Vaso are extremely kind, generous, friendly, and warm.  The home-made olive oil, jams, and freshly picked grapes and figs were delicious.   5 Stars is not enough.  This is the Greek Home You have always wanted.\",\"We were 4 adults and stayed in Villa Theros during May. We were really happy with our choice, the house is trully amazing. <br/>It is very clean and beautiful, the decoration is simple and tasteful and it is equipped with all things necessary. The balconies are large with a relaxing sea view. We really loved the fact that it is quiet and it has a large garden with trees and flowers. To our view the location is ideal because it is away from the everyday business of the town yet close enough to easily walk to the nearby beaches and the restaurants. The owners made us feel welcome and they were very kind and discreet. Overall we definitely recommend it and we will try to come back for a longer stay next time! <br/>Ευχαριστούμε πολύ για τη φιλοξενία!!\",\"The Villa is newly refurbished with all modern comforts, very clean and the owner is wonderfully helpful and quick in reply to any question.\",\"We had a great holiday at Villa Theros. Beautiful house and very comfortable because in addition to being in a lovely location, the furnishings and attention to detail  have made our stay super pleasant. Excellent cleaning and the presence of many accessories both in the kitchen and extra such as deckchairs and umbrellas to take to the beach.  And what about the owners who stay in the house next door: a mix of kindness, availability and friendliness.<br/>Super recommended !!! We will definitely be back!\",\"The house is perfectly as described: new, very well equipped and very comfortable. Michalis and his wife's welcome was exceptional, punctuated by small touches throughout our stay. They were perfect hosts, with great kindness, shared by many Greeks.

         "[\"We had an amazing stay at this beautiful place in Broadbeach! The apartment was spotless, well-equipped, and exactly as described. The location was perfect — close to everything yet peaceful and relaxing. The hosts were incredibly friendly, responsive, and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br/>Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. We’d definitely love to come back again!\",\"Fantastic stay at Broadbeach, amazing location and the condo was fully equipped with very comfortable beds. The place was squeaky clean and the Tim Tams on arrival was a cute thought. They’d really thought of everything that you’d need during the stay and we couldn’t have wanted anything more. Thanks again, we will definitely stay again!\",\"Amazing location walking distance to prestine beach, restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops with Woolworths literally next door. The accommodation itself was modernly furnished with great amenities and super clean. The service provided by Broadbeach Luxury Stays from inquiry to check-in was second to none. highly recommended.\",\"A great compact, modern apartment with excellent facilities.  Main bedroom great size with views and sliding doors which allow good breeze to flow through.  2nd bedroom has no window but is a good size.  Bathroom is jack and jill style - comfy bath to relax in and plenty of space for toiletries.  Well equipped kitchenette and laundry.  Walkable to Pacific Fair and restaurants in Broadie.  An enjoyable stay.  Would stay again.\",\"Amazing stay. <br/>All boxes ticked. Cleanliness, location, communication and comfort. Enjoyed our stay.\",\"From the check in through to the departure everything was just beautiful. The apartment has everything you need and it’s lovely sitting outside on the balcony enjoying the weather. The hosts were very helpful and provided a personal check in. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.\",\"it is rare to enter a property and immediately feel a sense of warmth and  comfort. It is also not often to find a property that ends up being better than the pics. Karin was extremely welcoming and informative. <br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all.our needs were provided for. <br/>The level of cleanliness is 5 star. We will certainly be returning.\",\"Great unit in the heart of Broadbeach. Kitchen facilities are handy. Located on level 6, room 608. Parking was in basement level 3. Cafe downstairs was very nice and convenient. <br/>It was fine for us but the main bedroom has a wall of frosted glass between the bathroom. No curtain so light at night lights up main bedroom. Would recommend a blind or curtain.\",\"Fantastic! Quite at night but still just a walk to everything\",\"Lovely decorated apartment that is very well stocked with all the essentials you need.<br/>Fantastic local\",\"The apartment was one of the best I have stayed in so clean beds were so comfortable they have thought of everything you would need it's a fantastic location for beach restaurants shopping had the best time thanks fir having us Cathy Alex  from New zealand\",\"We absolutely loved our four night stay. The check-in process with Karin was great and the unit itself was wonderful and in a terrific location. Could not recommend more highly.\",\"We were two colleagues, going to a conference at the conference centre. The location was great for this, being very walkable, with several cafes between the two. The beach was also a short walk away so this was a perfect location for us. The apartment has the bathroom in between the two bedrooms, so some bathroom door closure protocols had to be established between the two of us and it was fine. There is a big glass window between the bathroom and big bedroom, but the frosting on the glass reduces the view into the bathroom. There is one big bedroom with great views and one small bedroom without windows which can be dark. Cleanliness and functionality of everything was great. Would happily stay again.\",\"Highly recommend this apartment! Super comfortable space with lots of natural light! Great location 3 minute walk to the beach and host was responsive and met us for checkin. Would stay here again, thank you!\",\"Great place to stay highly recommend this property\",\"Great location, amazing hosts. Would stay again\",\"This is a lovely apartment to stay.  Close to everything, walk to beach and restaurants. Host lovely and friendly.  I will be back.\",\"Excellent accommodation, close to restaurants and beach\",\"Beautiful apartment! Amazing views!

Highly recommend staying here!\",\"Lovely clean, modern, well equipped apartment in a great location … couldn’t have asked for anything more!

A major attraction in the area is the fully restored amazing and historic Port Welshpool Long Jetty...a must visit family friendly jetty with beautiful safe beach surrounds. You can be as busy as you wish or relaxed as you may need:) there are so many things to do and see for adults and kids alike including great fishing, lovely safe beaches as well as bike tracks or if you like to walk or hike there are so many beautiful unspoilt areas for all to enjoy all within easy reach of Melbourne. Come stay and enjoy at a price we have set so a break is affordable to all -all we ask is that you treat the house as your own and respect the rate we charge and in return please clean on departure. Many thanks!The house has beautiful wooden cathedral ceilings with delightful character. Recently fully renovated with a new kitchen, bathroom and furnishings. A reverse cycle air conditioner for summer and winter comfort and great heating for those cosy winter nights and there is also a wood heater (so sorry wood not provided now as it would weirdly \"disappear\" when we did) There is a large lounge / open living plan with new kitchen with absolutely everything you will need along with microwave, ceramic cooktop,  Aldi Coffee maker and lots of bench space and walk in pantry. There is a 50” Ultra HD TV along with the Foxtel Entertainment Package which includes 9 Sports Channels for the boys (including Fox Sports) plus STAN for your enjoyment ...and FREE WIFITwo good size bedrooms one with a comfy queen bed (including 37\" TV in the main bedroom) and the other with a double bed and a single so comfortably sleeps 5.Along 2 full sides of the house is a delightful covered verandah that gets lots of sun and shade (not to mention the peaceful outlook lovely to view the native birds and a lovely area to have breakie or have a drink or BBQ in the eve- there is a gas BBQ available. We have several board games to play which we often do!! If you have a boat there is lots of room on the large easily accessible corner block with the store (great fish and chips), the beach and jetty just a few minutes walk away. – So bring the kids fishing rods!NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen, towels and toiletries etc (everything else is there incl shampoo body wash, hand soaps, toilet rolls etc) and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)PETS: Also please note (and sorry) we do not allow pets after three VERY bad experiences. We used to welcome the family pet as we have animals ourselves, but many dollars later with repairs we have had to make due to irresponsible people we have now changed our policy - apologies to all the responsible pet owners out there.ATTRACTIONS IN THE AREA (and Things to do just to name a few)The brand new and famous (now totally restored) Port Welshpool Long JettyA lovely kid’s safe beachWhale Watching cruises leave from Port Welshpool (seasonal)Wilsons PromAgnes FallsToora Wind FarmTarra Bulga National Park – Wow!Port Albert (Historic Fishing Village)Lovely Cafes in Toora, Foster and YarramGreat Fishing and Swimming Wildlife galoreLovely Walkways, bike tracks and Tramping optionsHistoric Museums WELCOME TO PORT WELSHPOOL -VICTORIAS SECRET A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVENThe Port and surrounds Port Welshpool is a lovely drive of about 90 minutes from Cranbourne once you hit the Sth Gippsland Highway and is in an undiscovered \"peaceful paradise\" just a short drive from beautiful and unspoilt Wilsons Prom. We own our lovely \"home away from home\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \"The Port\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.Guest accessEntire houseOther things to noteNOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)",

         "[\"It’s a nice peaceful place to get away from busy city life. Great location, a walking distance to the beach and the local pub. Short drive to Toora where  we had really nice coffee and thick shakes at The Windmill Cafe with so friendly staff. <br/>Beautiful scenery around Foster.<br/>The house warm, cosy  and comfortable which feel like home.<br/> Thanks Kerry Jo and Ezra, we definitely come back next time.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>Loan\",\"This home and area was so beautiful, was completely in awe of everything. The hosts were super nice and had a clear manual of everything you may need and the home is just the cutest most cozy place and you can really tell how beautiful these people are by this house. We drove to Wilson’s prom and it was incredible, felt like I was in another country, will definitely be coming back!!\",\"The hosts were very happy to help with anything before, during and afterwards in constant communication. The house exceeded our expectations, was fully functional felt like home away from home. Would definitely like to come back again soon for another visit. Thank you so much guy we really appreciate your hospitality!!\uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDE00\uD83D\uDE05\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"What a gem!!! \uD83D\uDC8E <br/>Perfect base to explore The Prom and Tara Bulga National Park (which we would have missed if this wasn’t included in the house description). Home was a perfect home away from home. Had absolutely everything we could possibly need. <br/>The hosts opting to have guests byo linen and self clean made it affordable for us. It was so clean and tidy (more so than some other places we’ve stayed at) <br/>Thank you Kerry Jo and Ezra. We will be recommending this place to our friends and family.\",\"We had a very pleasant weekend stay. We had a great time driving around the area. The house is cool and relaxing. I like the interior, complete stuff and close to the pier. Easy to communicate with the host.\",\"Had the best weekend here in port welshpool!

The WIFI was brilliant in this regional area to my surprise too. It was all I hoped for being quiet  and secluded with decking surrounded by greenery. Perfect location to adventure out to Wilson's Prom, Agnes Falls and the Tarra-Bulga National Park. Can't stress enough...Extremely good value reduced to simply treat their house like you would your own (and we stayed in high holiday season when caravan parks were costly). We had a lovely intimate family Christmas escape from the city to the fresh air and quiet peaceful surrounds. Check out the general store for some great fish and chips too! Kerry, Jo and Ezra are fabulous hosts responding quickly (even over Christmas) to any questions and providing a wealth of information on the area which is also listed in a binder on arrival. Thankyou for a wonderful Christmas stay guys! Will be back again and again.\",\"Clean & tidy place with good ammenities, full kitchen equipment, comfortable sofa & bed, fits 4-5 people with a good price.<br/>Host is very friendly and easy going, we mentioned that we arrived late (Friday night after work) on the check in day - they offered to stay another night for free if we could extend our trip but unfortunately we couldn’t, then we had late check out around 2pm instead.<br/>Recommended \uD83D\uDC4C\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"Truly a home away from home with the most well-equipped kitchen.  Kerry, Jo And Ezra were very friendly and gave very clear instructions before our stay. There is also a lovely waterfall in 15 mins drive, which is perfect for an early morning walk. The best budget-friendly choice! :)\",\"Was the perfect accommodation for a trip down to Wilsons Prom! Very spacious yet very home-y, fit for a group of friends or family. Effective communication from the hosts as well.

Really good setup, large kitchen, great workspace. Fire is always a bonus, foxtel was a real novelty, watched a few Ghostbusters gems. House is really well built we had crazy winds when we visited and the house barely creaked or whistled, it felt really secure. Love the “clean it yourself” vibes it’s a great idea. Thanks for having us.\",\"Very positive to communicate, friendly and have every thing ready in the room, recommended\",\"quaint little cottage with everything you need for a stay close to some great local attractions\",\"Lovely and peaceful.

We own our lovely \\\"home away from home\\\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \\\"The Port\\\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\"},{\"title\":\"Guest access\",\"value\":\"Entire house\"},{\"title\":\"Other things to note\",\"value\":\"NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \\\"relaxees\\\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\"}]",

An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. \n<br>\nHarold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter&apos;s Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 \n<br>\n<br>\nThe township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Guest access</span>\n<br>\nEntire house\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Other things to note</span>\n<br>\nNOTE: \n<br>\nAll you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next &quot;relaxees&quot; we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\n</span>\n",

         "Cuba apartment will provide you an excellent location right in the heart of Brasov Old Town, 50m from the Black Church. In the same time, it is a quiet place with an amazing view of the forest behind the city walls towards the White Tower.The place is located in one of the iconic historical buildings in Brasov. It was built in the 18th Century on the old City walls(you can still see the old city wall from the window) and the building was used as a the main eye hospital in Transilvania.The spaceThe apartment was designed in a way that it keeps some of its' older vibe, but in the same time provide its' guests with the highest level of comfort possible.Since the ceilings are so high, we took advantage of this for the first bedroom where we designed a whole structure so that we can have the bed on an upper level, thus taking advantage of the space below where we set up a small desk and some storage spaces. We also welcome you to the round table, which is a perfect place to have some fun with your family or friends. This space also works as a living room since it's exactly above the entrance of the apartment in a common accessed area For the other bedroom, given the size of the room, we went for large pieces of furniture, trying also to keep a more vintage aspect to it and not overcrowd the room.  You will immediately notice the old wood stove in the corner which towers and looks over the whole room from the corner.The kitchen and the bathroom are both fully equipped for any of your needs, and we also wanted to make sure that both of them have something special to offer to our guests from a design perspective. You will notice the old wood stove in the bathroom as it is has been transformed to encompass the sink area.Guest accessFor parking you have one available 100 meters away. Given the central location I highly recommend you ditch the car and explore the city by foot. There is also a bus station close by to explore other parts of the city, and if you enjoy skiing during winter, or just want to have a stroll, the bus station towards Poiana Brasov is only 500 meters away.",

         "[\"Lovely apartment, clean and suited a family of four. Our kids are 9 and 11 and enjoyed the mezzanine bed. Very tastefully decorated and close to main square in Brasov.\",\"We arrive from the airport and it was about 15 minutes walk. Sobway/metro was just around the corner. had a few restaurants within walking distance. overall good\",\"The Apartment was advertised as a 2 bedrooms apartment. In reality  our 2 grownup kids had to crawl to the matress up in the gallery/attic. We  filled our kids age in the filling forms. It was clear that our children are grownups. Yet the apartment was promoted as a 2 bedrooms apartment suitable for 4 persons. The second room was not a bedroom, but rather a dinning room with a mattress  at the attic. Not suitable for adult grownup children. Our children didn't sleep well in a suitable bed and it ruined all our stay. We think it would be appropriate to be truthfull with the advertisement and discription of the apartment. Not suitable for a familly with big children.\",\"Pros: absolutely stunning apartment, fantastic decorations, very clean, comfortable beds, large TV, close to main square (2 min walk), easy access, friendly staff, responsive owner, large bathroom<br/>Cons: thin walls and next door Airbnb has a piano which guests played at 1am, second bedroom on mezzanine above main front door not that private and could get noise from squeaky floors\",\"I stayed here for three days and absolutely loved it. The place is wonderful—cozy, intimate, beautifully designed, and very practical. It has a special charm, with heritage pieces that give it a unique and refined atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can’t wait to return to.<br/>During my stay, I had three days of work and found the space very conducive to productivity. Unfortunately, on the first day, there was a lot of noise from a team of workers nearby, which disrupted my focus. However, the hosts were incredibly attentive and welcoming. As soon as I mentioned the issue, they promptly took care of it, and from the second day onwards, it was perfectly quiet.<br/>I’m very grateful for their hospitality and care and would definitely come back again for both work and leisure. A truly special place!\",\"So beautiful my wife asked how do we buy this place as soon as we walked in. Hard with parking and a family though as summer in Brasov is busy and not always lots of parking. But the place itself is amazing.  My son loved sleeping in the loft bed which was an awesome experience\",\"We had an amazing stay in this beautiful apartment. The bedroom is stunning. Right in the centre of town. Highly recommend.\",\"An absolutely beautiful flat, nicer than the photos in the listing. Very comfortable, set back from the street and very quiet with a lovely view of trees.\",\"Great apartment in a great location with a gorgeous kitchen and main bedroom.\",\"Really beautiful place! We had a great time. It is in an ideal location\",\"Andreis Flat is just beautiful. We really felt like home and would for sure come again!\",\"Clean spacious place. Close to everything!\",\"Amazing stay, central location and nice restaurants.\",\"Great place…perfect location\",\"I recommend it.\",\"Everything went great! :)\",\"The apartment is as shown in the pictures! Very spacious, tidy and tastefully decorated. Outstanding location. Andrei very friendly and antento. Highly recommended! :)\",\"What a great accommodation! It is right next to the old square and the master bedroom has a gorgeous view of the White Tower and a lush green backyard full of cherry trees. The master is like a bedroom for royalty. Large and spacious to the extreme. The second bedroom is more of a platform bed, rather than a room itself. The kitchen has the basic necessities for morning coffee and scrambled eggs\uD83D\uDE0A. There are many great restaurants within a short walking distance. Andrei was super responsive and flexible with our checkin time. I highly recommend this Airbnb\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB\",\"Fantastic two night stay at Cuba apartment. Beautifully decorated. Spotlessly clean. Warm and cozy despite the snow outside . Great views from the windows of the Brasov sign and white tower. Very responsive hosts . <br/>The perfect location to stay  in beautiful Brasov square.  I highly recommend and will definitely return to Brasov and stay here again .\",\"This is a wonderful spacious apartment, beautifully furnished, quite location, super clean and airy, in the heart of Brasov. Andrei is a gem! He was  incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive to our needs.<br/>The weather wasn't the greatest but Andrei's place made this trip one to remember.<br/>Thank you ever so much, Andrei!<br/>Looking forward to visiting again some time soon!\",\"We are Romanians living abroad, returning to our country for vacations as often as we can. Brasov and the surrounding areas are some of our favourite places to be. <br/>We tried a good few places in Brasov, but this one is hands down the best of them all! <br/>I love how they carefully saved the architecture of the building, the old fireplaces with museum worthy features and the wooden floors. <br/>You can see that’s someone is taking great care of this place. <br/>Highly recommended!!!\",\"I travelled for 3 weeks across Netherlands, Austria and Romania and this was by far the best place we stayed at. Well designed, lots of space, high ceilings, big bathroom space, everything was great. Even the view from the window while it snowed was magical. While Andrei helped us on chat, we met one of the hosts in person - Toni and had some great conversations. Toni set us up with a great guide/host who took us around all the castles. Overall an amazing experience and a great space and right next to the town square.\",\"The apartment is right in the heart of the old town center. Everything you would want to visit or see is in walking distance. <br/>From the bedroom you have a great view of the White Tower. From the living room you can see the top of the Tampa mountain with the BRASOV sign, over the rooftops.  <br/>The kitchen is top modern and the bathroom is huge. The bedroom is enormous. Everything looks exactly as in the pictures.\",\"We rented this space for the 4 of us. We got there and we were so impressed by the interior design, everything is newly renovated, a mix of modern but with rustic colours, well thought. Also the romanian traditional heaters (soba) were kept in, so impressed and appreciated. <br/>The beds are comfortable. The big bedroom is really huge, we loved it! <br/>The location is best you can get, right in the heart of the city. <br/>Highly recommend this! We can't wait to return back again!\"]",

         "[\"We truly enjoyed staying here and wished we could stay even longer. Michalis greeted us and shared recommendations for the best restaurants, beaches, etc on Paros and Antiparos which was super helpful! The house is only 10 minute walk from the village which gave us privacy and amazing views. The house is well equipped and clean. The back terrace was our favorite place to hang out in the evenings while watching the sunset.\",\"Absolutely loved our stay! Spacious and very clean, one room is completely separate which was great for the couples to have their own areas and the amenities were perfect! Great for families or couples!\",\"We had a great time at Michalis's place, very welcoming host and available anytime. The place was in pristine condition with all the necessary amenities. A breathtaking sea view in the middle of nature . We highly recommend your place to stay. No negative points.\",\"Wounderful stay. Amazing house with a lot of space and everything you need to unwind and just relax! Very friendly and welcoming host. Highly recommended!\",\"Nice people <br/>Helpful <br/>Slightly out of the way however nice privacy \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\",\"Perfect accommodation, spacious and comfortable, with a wonderful terrace for after-dinner drinks. Everything was great\",\"We felt at home. Michalis and his wife were always available to help us, very responsive but most of all very very sweet! The house was beautiful and clean and has a breathtaking view. They left water, wine, local olive oil and anything we could need for the beach as well. So many nice touches. We were a group of friends and I hope to take my family here one day. Thank you both!\",\"Very good hosting by Michalis, full of good advice. Perfect house. Very nice place.\",\"Beautiful home, breathtaking views, 5-10 min walk to Aliki, its beautiful beaches and delicious waterfront restaurants. A place we highly recommend, much nicer than the more touristy towns of Parikia or Naoussa. Very comfortable bedding, very well-equipped kitchen, impeccable cleanliness, beach chairs and umbrella very much appreciated. And Michalis is very available, kind, enthusiastic, generous with his time and information. Is there any better compliment?<br/>Thanks for everything.\",\"Everything was perfect, the house is very clean and beautiful, with a nice area in front of the house that has a stunning view on the sea. Michelis and his wife are very nice hosts, trying to make everything they can to make you enjoy your stay. Definitely a place I recomand !\",\"The villa fits comfortably the needs of 6 adults.The place is quiet and the seaview as well as sunset view are superb.The cleanliness of the villa and the kindness of the host are both strong arguments to recommend the villa.\",\"Great stay, the house is superb and we were able to enjoy the outdoors and the garden.<br/>Our host was very nice and available. I would recommend this place, close to the center and easy to access. Thank you\",\"This is exactly what all Airbnb experiences should be like. The perfect stay in a dream villa. The warm host Michalis took care of every need and surprised us along the way. The villa is very spacious with amazing views. It is impeccably clean, and the terrace is a gorgeous place to spend your evening with a Greek wine overlooking the Aegean. I have stayed in villas around the world and I don't have a single piece of feedback - I can only recommend it to whoever reads this message.\",\"We visited Villa Theros in August. The house is even better than the photos. It is brand new. It is decorated with taste and character. It is fully equipped and has a great BBQ spot. The verandas are amazing with a great view. The garden is very well maintained. Our daughter loved collecting figs from the trees. We really appreciated that the surrounding area was peaceful. The owners were great and welcoming. Communication before arrival was really good and precise. So sad we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely go back again!\",\"An Airbnb can not get better in our opinion. If we were ever to own one we would model it after what Michalis and his wife have created. It was perfection for us. Loved the location and the peace and quiet. Yet it is only a short walk to shops and restaurants. What a delightful find... it was our favorite place in Greece.\",\"Michalis’ villa exceeded our expectations in every way. He’s house was so well appointed thought out and tastefully designed with everything we needed in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms . There is an amazing outdoor kitchen and gorgeous back deck with the most amazing sunsets and views . There was also a  fruit and vegetable garden we could pick from to add to our breakfasts and dinners. Every moment in the day was tranquil and picturesque with unobstructed views of the surrounding hills and oceans.<br/>Michalis was a kind and generous host and supplied us everything we could need . He had  lists, maps and tours all ready for us. If you are thinking about coming to Paros please consider staying at Michalis Villa , PARADISE !!!\",\"We stayed at Villa Theros as a group of six for nine days in September. <br/>I cannot reccommend it enough. The accommodation is spacious, tasteful, equipped with everything you could possibly need and it is brand new. <br/>It is in a peaceful yet convenient location about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the local village and beaches. The views over the surrounding are and sea are amazing. Michalis and Vaso were so friendly, fantastic hosts and seriously went above and beyond to ensure our experience was the best possible. Their advice on where to explore on the island was also invaluable. <br/>Overall, a fantastic experience and would not hesitate to return.\",\"5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH for this home.   You will love it, no question.  It is wonderfully renovated, exquisitely decorated, generously hosted, thoroughly supplied, and strategically located.  It is quiet and relaxing, perfect inside/out, and offers glorious views of country, sea, and town.    You will adore this home, we can guarantee it.  Our credentials to review are bolstered by at least 100 previous rental experiences in countries around the world.  This home brought together the best of all of those experiences, and none of the bad.  Many places we have stayed before have had lovely views, but poor renovation or equipping.  That was not the case here, it is the full package and leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.   The quality of the renovation is impeccable, carefully considered, and obviously the fruit of professional architects and interior designers.  That is only the beginning.  The furnishing and decoration are attractive, subtle, and practical.   The kitchen is a gift to travelers like us that have spent too much time in other rentals looking for sharp knives, cutting boards, oil/salts, or other simple and obvious things.  The hosts have handled the basic, and gone above and beyond to a degree that made us feel perfectly at home, and their concern and thoroughness was truly amazing.    As for the hosts, Michalis and Vaso are extremely kind, generous, friendly, and warm.  The home-made olive oil, jams, and freshly picked grapes and figs were delicious.   5 Stars is not enough.  This is the Greek Home You have always wanted.\",\"We were 4 adults and stayed in Villa Theros during May. We were really happy with our choice, the house is trully amazing. <br/>It is very clean and beautiful, the decoration is simple and tasteful and it is equipped with all things necessary. The balconies are large with a relaxing sea view. We really loved the fact that it is quiet and it has a large garden with trees and flowers. To our view the location is ideal because it is away from the everyday business of the town yet close enough to easily walk to the nearby beaches and the restaurants. The owners made us feel welcome and they were very kind and discreet. Overall we definitely recommend it and we will try to come back for a longer stay next time! <br/>Ευχαριστούμε πολύ για τη φιλοξενία!!\",\"The Villa is newly refurbished with all modern comforts, very clean and the owner is wonderfully helpful and quick in reply to any question.\",\"We had a great holiday at Villa Theros. Beautiful house and very comfortable because in addition to being in a lovely location, the furnishings and attention to detail  have made our stay super pleasant. Excellent cleaning and the presence of many accessories both in the kitchen and extra such as deckchairs and umbrellas to take to the beach.  And what about the owners who stay in the house next door: a mix of kindness, availability and friendliness.<br/>Super recommended !!! We will definitely be back!\",\"The house is perfectly as described: new, very well equipped and very comfortable. Michalis and his wife's welcome was exceptional, punctuated by small touches throughout our stay. They were perfect hosts, with great kindness, shared by many Greeks. Villa Theros is highly recommendable!\"]",
